### My Great Heading

Simply put, the larger your tire,the more of a grip your vehicle has on the road. As a tire's width increases, it covers more surface area on the road. According to iSee Cars, this increase in contact with the pavement gives your vehicle more to hold onto, increasing its  [handling and ability to maneuver](https://www.iseecars.com/articles/does-tire-size-really-matter).So, does tire size really matter? The short answer is: Yes. But does wheel size matter? It depends.Wheels and tires are not interchangeable words. Tires are a part of the wheel setup. For instance, your vehicle has a set size of rims, but you can buy different sizes of tires to fit those rims, as long as the middle of the tires is the correct size. That being said, a vehicle with bigger rims will often be able to fit larger tires than other vehicles.
