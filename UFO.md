###  According to the disputed Tulli Papyrus, the scribes of the pharaoh Thutmose III reported that "fiery disks" were encountered floating over the skies. The Condon Committee disputed the legitimacy of the Tulli Papyrus stating:
>### "Tulli was taken in and that the papyrus is a fake."

### Flame-like  pithoi  from the sky

According to [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch "Plutarch"), a Roman army commanded by [Mithridates VI of Pontus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI_of_Pontus "Mithridates VI of Pontus") when "all on a sudden, the sky burst asunder, and a huge, flame-like body was seen to fall between the two armies. In shape, it was most like a wine-jar, and in colour, like molten silver." Plutarch reports the shape of the object as like a wine-jar ([pithos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pithos "Pithos")). The apparently silvery object was reported by both armies.

##### 19th century

On February 22 (or March 24) in 1803 local fishermen reportedly saw a vessel drifting in close by waters. They say when they investigated it, "a beautiful young woman" they described as having red and white hair and dressed in strange clothes appeared. The fishermen claim she held a square box "that no one was allowed to touch" and she spoke to them in a language they never heard before. Some UFO believers think this story was a credible document of a close encounter of the third kind in Japan. Historians and Ethnologists consider it folklore.

>“To my way of thinking, there is every bit as much evidence for the  
existence of UFOs as there is for the existence of God. Probably far  
more. At least in the case of UFOs there have been countless taped  
and filmed and, by the way, unexplained sightings from all over the  
world, along with documented radar evidence seen by experienced  
military and civilian radar operators.”
>>George Carlin
